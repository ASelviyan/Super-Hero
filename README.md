# Super_Hero Read Me
## Project Idea and Decription
- My idea is to create a app that allows user to enter the app with a username and password 
- The user will have a list of super_heros that they can search up by using the search bar 
- They can enter that heros details page and look at there details
- The user can add a hero to there team 
- They can also enter a community page where they can look at other users teams and comment on them
